# Some versions of the python:2.7 Docker image remove this library, which
# uwsgi needs for routing support to be enabled.
# We may be able to remove this after https://github.com/docker-library/python/pull/137
# is fixed.
# However, node and npm are to build the frontend. nodejs-legacy is needed by this version of npm.
