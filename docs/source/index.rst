   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Balrog's documentation!
==================================
**Balrog** is the software that runs the server side component of the update system used by Firefox and other Mozilla products. 
It is the successor to AUS (Application Update Service), which did not scale to our current needs nor allow us to adapt to more recent business requirements. 
Balrog helps us ship updates faster and with much more flexability than we've had in the past.
