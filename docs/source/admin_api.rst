::

    {
        "count": 2,
        "rules": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "change_id": 4,
            "timestamp": 1451610061000,
            "changed_by": "jane",
            "product": "Firefox",
            ...
        },
        {

This endpoint supports pagination.
If "page" and "limit" are present in the query args, a slice of the revisions is returned instead of the full history.
Eg: if the page is "2" and the limit is "5", the 6th through 10th revisions would be returned. "count" is not affected by pagination - it will always return the total number of revisions that exist.


POST
****

Reverts the rule identified by the given id (alias is not supported here) to the version identified by the change_id given in the request body.
The request body must be a JSON object containing a "change_id" key.

GET
***

      ]
    }

Releases
--------

**/releases**
-------------

GET
***

Returns a JSON Object containing metadata about Releases in Balrog's database.
Due to its size, the actual Release "blob" is never returned from this endpoint.
There are a few query arguments that affect its response.
If no arguments are provided, it returns information about all of the Releases in the database in the following format:

::

    {
      "releases": [
        {
          "name": "Firefox-34.0-build1",
          "product": "Firefox",
          "data_version": 4,
          "read_only": null
        },
        {
          "name": "Fennec-34.0-build1",
          "product": "Fennec",
          "data_version": 43,
          "read_only": true
          },
          ...
      ]
    }



If "product" is passed, only Releases with the given product name will be returned.
If "name_prefix" is passed, only Releases whose name starts with the given prefix will be returned.
If "names_only" is set to true, the response changes format and provides a list of all of the Release names in the database:

::

    {
      "names": [
        "Firefox-34.0-build1",
        "Fennec-34.0-build1",
        ...

      "schema_version": 4,
      "platforms": {
