# There's a lot going on in this file, and a lot of duplicated logic across multiple tasks.
# Here's a summary of what we're doing for CI and Release:
#  - We run backend, frontend, agent, and client tests on every push
#    to the master branch, and every pull request.
#
#    - Ideally, we'd run tests for pushes to any branch, but every time
#      a tag is created, it makes a push event that overrides the tests
#      that already ran on that commit on the master branch. Limiting
#      push events to the master branch avoids the messiness this
#      generates.
#
#  - We build new docker images upon every push to the master branch.
#    These show up on Dockerhub with tags that reference the commit.
#
#  - We build new docker images upon every Release (the official kind
#    that are created through the Github UI -- not just tags). These
#    show up on Dockerhub with tags that reference the Release version.
#
# Things we would like to do in the future:
#  - Block all docker image creation tasks on tests passing. This is blocked
#    on support for decision tasks (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1252144).
#
#  - Build and publish the client library whenever a Release happens.
