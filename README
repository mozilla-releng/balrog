Balrog is a rewrite of the Application Update Server used by Mozilla to
provide updates to Firefox. It uses a database to store a series of rules
which map update requests to releases. Documentation is available at
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Balrog.

To run a development environment you must have Docker and docker-compose
installed (if you're on Windows or Mac you need "Docker for Windows" or "Docker
for Mac" at least v1.12.0). Once these prerequisites are installed, run the
following command to create and run the necessary images:

  docker-compose up

MySQL data will persist across runs and stored under `.cache/mysql`. To reset
the data, you can delete the directory and run `docker-compose up`.

Now you should be able to access the admin interface at:
http://127.0.0.1:8080

And you can access the public interface with URLs such as:
http://127.0.0.1:9090/update/3/Firefox/33.0/20141202185629/Darwin_x86_64-gcc3-u-i386-x86_64/en-US/release/default/default/default/update.xml?force=1
