Balrog is a rewrite of the Application Update Server used by Mozilla to
provide updates to Firefox. It uses a database to store a series of rules
which map update requests to releases. Documentation is available at
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Balrog.

To run a development environment you must have Docker and docker-compose
installed (if you're on Windows or Mac you probably want Docker Machine as
well). Once these prerequisites are installed, run the following command to
create  and run the necessary images:

  docker-compose up

MySQL data will persist across runs and stored under `.cache/mysql`. To reset
the data, you can delete the directory and run `docker-compose up`.

Now you should be able to access the admin interface at:
http://127.0.0.1:8080

And you can access the public interface with URLs such as:
http://127.0.0.1:9090/update/3/Firefox/33.0/20141202185629/Darwin_x86_64-gcc3-u-i386-x86_64/en-US/release/default/default/default/update.xml?force=1

If you're on Mac, Windows, or running Docker in a VM for another reason, you'll need to replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP of your VM. eg with 'docker-machine ip'
