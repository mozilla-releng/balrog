    **Balrog** is the software that runs the server side component of the update
    system used by Firefox and other Mozilla products. It is the successor to *AUS*
    (Application Update Service), which did not scale to our current needs nor allow
    us to adapt to more recent business requirements. Balrog helps us ship updates faster
    and with much more flexibility than we’ve had in the past.
