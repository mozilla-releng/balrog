        Returns a JSON Object containing metadata about Releases in Balrog’s database. Due to its size, the actual Release “blob” is never returned from this endpoint.
        There are a few query arguments that affect its response:
          -If no arguments are provided, it returns information about all of the Releases;
          -If "product" is passed, only Releases with the given product name will be returned;
          -If "name_prefix" is passed, only Releases whose name starts with the given prefix will be returned;
          -If "names_only" is set to true, the response changes format and provides a list of all of the Release names.
      produces:
        - application/json

        - $ref: '#/parameters/productQueryParam'
        - name: name_prefix
