    # Top level fileUrls are useful primarily for release style builds,
    # where the URLs are predictable and only vary by locale and platform.
    # It"s worth noting that while we normally serve different channels
    # through different fileUrls (eg, ftp.mozilla.org vs. download.mozilla.org),
    # each platform+locale combination is expected to receive the same
    # MAR contents regardless of channel. As of yet there is no way to
    # specify different metadata for different channels so doing anything
    # other than above will result in MAR verification failures on the client.
