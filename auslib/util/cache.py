    have two consumers of the auslib library (admin app, non-admin app) that
    require different caching behaviour. The admin app should never cache
    anything, but the non-admin app should. This class is intended to be
    instantiated as a global object, and then have caches created by consumers
    through calls to make_cache.

    If the cache given to get/put/clear/invalidate doesn't exist, these methods
    are essentially no-ops. In a world where bug 1109295 is fixed, we might
    only need to handle the caching case."""
