# NOTE: The only supported way to use the Balrog dev image is with a volume mount of /app.
# Because of this, the only things we do in the Dockerfile are install things to
# system locations (some system packages and some python packages).
# Things that are fully local to /app (such as npm requirements and the built UI)
# are done as needed in the entrypoint.

# Some versions of the python:2.7 Docker image remove libpcre3, which uwsgi needs for routing support to be enabled.
# Node and npm are to build the frontend. nodejs-legacy is needed by this version of npm.
# mysql-client is needed to import sample data
# libmysqlclient-dev is required to use SQLAlchemy with MySQL, which we do in production.
# libfontconfig1 is required by phantomjs
