# Contributing to Balrog

In order to effectively work on Balrog you will need to be able to both run its tests and local development environment. You will need a recent version of Docker, Docker Compose, and tox to do these things.

The [README](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/blob/master/README.rst) talks about this in depth.

## Finding bugs to work on

If you're new to Balrog, it is recommended that you find a [first bug](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-bug) to look at as a starting point. Otherwise, the [Admin](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/labels/admin), [Agent](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/labels/agent), [Public](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/labels/public), and [DB](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/labels/db) labels cover most of the open backend issues (written in Python), while the [frontend](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/balrog/labels/frontend) label covers the frontend issues (written in React).
